- some of the scenes have incredible detail. 80s mecha animation looks incredible
- the main conceit of some unknown force causing mechas to misbehave isn't enough to drive the entire movie
  - it tries to make some comments on technological progress and urbanization, but they're not very good?
  - the religious references never went anywhere
- so we just kill the big bad, hug, then smash cut to credits?
