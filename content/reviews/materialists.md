- i can't help but feel this is celine song monologuing her conflicting internal views on relationships/dating rather than watching a story unfold
- sophie situation felt rushed to a conclusion. it also doesn't seem to alter lucy's view on her job or how she handles relationships. it's a minor (for lucy) speed bump that gets pushed aside with the final phone call.
- sophie really needs to make some friends.
- pedro's line delivery and squatting during "the scene" was great
