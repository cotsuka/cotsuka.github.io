- every scene can be a photo on its own. the color grading (and natural taiwan backdrop) are stunning
- first half of the movie i was trying to figure out if they're siblings or dating
- not much in the way of dialogue. more of a vibe/feeling movie
- lung's stuck in the past while chin is a modern woman. they play on this a lot when comparing taiwan to america
- yo-yo ma on the beat
