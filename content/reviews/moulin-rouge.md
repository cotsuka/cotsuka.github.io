- fun remixes of songs to weave into the overarching love story
- drags a bit in places
- baz luhrmann always creates these over-the-top universes
- appreciate his willingness to step out of "reality" in several places. e.g., using a miniature set of paris for some scenes where characters are "talking" to each other
- he really liked the slo-mo shots
