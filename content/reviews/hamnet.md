- the first fourth of the movie went a bit long. i think tightening those scenes up would still keep the emotional tie to agnes without dragging
- use of color and framing enhanced the story. especially the use of the veil with hamnet
- on the nature of daylight in the last scene feels a bit lazy. the song is so good you could slap it over anything
- very impressed with hamnet child actor's performance
- the plot was somehow exactly what i expected, without being what i expected
