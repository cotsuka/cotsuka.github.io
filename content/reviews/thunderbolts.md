- the writing and acting is very uneven. valentina goes from supervillain to bad jokester
- nice terminator reference
- florence pugh's yelena and lewis pullman's bob were well-acted
- depression man makes for a decent core for this story
- final fight scene made me think of eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
