- classic lynch film where i wonder whether i'm dumb or just not creative enough to see all the symbolism
- really like the treatment of dreams, both literally and figuratively
- even if i didn't consciously put all the pieces together, i subconsciously knew exactly what this movie was about — in that, lynch and his editor did an excellent job
- it probably didn't need the entire "crying" cover, but i'm certainly glad we got it
- there are several threads that seem to get opened but are never returned to. after learning it was originally meant to be a tv series, maybe they should have gone back and re-filmed or rearranged some of this?
