- the things we do to ourselves in the pursuit of eternal youth
- ernest having the redemption arc was unexpected, although i think this takes away a bit from the main critique?
- campy as hell
  - shotgunning a hole into helen
  - fabio ðŸ˜‚
  - "dead" celebs just randomly showing up in the background: elvis, jim morrison, andy warhol, etc.
- this isn't going to ever be at the top of your "best movies" list, but it's a fun watch for a fall night in
