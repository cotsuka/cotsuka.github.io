- absolute tone shift from the first movie. this is more of an ocean's 11, caper-style movie than the heat remake the first was
- what was going on with this plot?
- donnie spent years collecting info and carefully plotting to make the first movie's premise believable. this movie, he haphazardly puts together a plan, gets lucky nick is law enforcement, decides to fully trust him after they go partying for a night?
- nick breaking bad then coming back could have been interesting if they actually set anything up to keep the stakes high. instead he monologues midway through the movie. what happened to, "show, don't tell?"
- shoving the bulkiest guys into a taycan with rifles just looks ridiculous on-screen
- why would the mafia save these guys? seems like they shoved this into the script to set up a sequel
- we're totally going to get a fast and furious-style franchise aren't we? den of thieves: spaziale, where nick convinces the federal reserve bank of la that he needs to defend a secret stash of gold bullion on the far side of the moon
