- the maybe it exists/maybe it doesn't theme throughout is interesting, but the movie pushes towards a certain reading
- is the ending actually the story he's writing?
  - zoom out from her window, where he's typing on a laptop
  - last two scenes are only ones where we aren't chained to his perspective
  - he's been insular and passive the entire time. complete change
- steven yeun does a great job here
