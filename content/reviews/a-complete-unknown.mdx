- if i was rating timothée chalamet, edward norton, and monica barbaro for their performances, this would be ★★★★★
- bob dylan is self-absorbed, johnny cash likes him for it?
- maybe stop introducing new musicians every 2 scenes
- honestly not sure what more there is to this movie besides being a vehicle to let timmy tim perform dylan songs
