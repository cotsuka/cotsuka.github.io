- harry is a pretty unlikable guy
- he's just biding his time in the friend zone for 20 years?
- after reading rob reiner changed the ending after meeting his wife, this movie makes more sense to me. i didn't think the initial parts of the story really laid the groundwork for the ending
- overall though, story and writing were great. iconic movie that has now turned into rom-com tropes
