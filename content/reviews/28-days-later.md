- soundtrack is just as good as i remember with brian eno and godspeed you! black emperor
- forgot how much of this movie is actually silent with minimal talking
- middle drags just a tad
- editing with quick cuts and slightly shaky handheld camera style adds to the confusion and tension they're trying to build
