- this is brad pitt's top gun
- you're telling me sonny shows up, decades out of f1, tells the aerodynamicist (and strategist?) to shove it, and they start winning? as an f1 fan, this movie is completely ridiculous. for non-f1/racing fans, i'd think the weak plot doesn't make this more than an ok popcorn flick
- could do without the love story and board member drama. would have been more interesting to see the friendship between sonny and ruben explored more fully as a reflection against sonny and joshua
- if you're a racing fan, you'll notice many references to past events:
  - crashgate
  - rosberg - hamilton fights
  - gasly crashes with teammates
  - peroni curb launch
  - grosjean fireball
  - red bull repairing their car on track
  - abu dhabi restart between hamilton and verstappen
- they did a good job of explaining some of the finer points of f1 and its rules for an uninformed audience
- in-car cinematography was beautiful
