import Spoiler from '@components/ui/spoiler.astro';

- overall pacing was fun, kept my attention the whole way
- chase infiniti was excellent
- timing on this release really aligned with the culture war zeitgeist
- turns out sensei is the true revolutionary: doing what he does without ego, taking care of his business

<Spoiler>
  - lockjaw did not need to come back at the end
  - is bob no longer being pursued for his prior revolutionary activities? did he just give up at the end of the movie?
