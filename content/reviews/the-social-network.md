- sorkin transforms the rise of facebook into a warning about "trading morals for glory" and class struggle that overexaggerates the reality
- trent reznor and atticus ross did an incredible job with this soundtrack. the soundscapes add tension and pace to the scene
- at least they got some of the terminal commands right. and my guy was using kde? i'm pretty sure we were all on macbooks in college
