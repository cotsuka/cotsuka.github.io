- noticing the little things in life
- very shinto vibes:
  - *komorebi*
  - god is in everything
  - the aya kōda reference; inspiration?
- i have never seen this floor cleaning technique in my life
- clearly family drama he's still moving past:
  - his niece's mention of the terrapin?
- everybody in their own different, little worlds

enjoying your routine, waking up early with a smile on your face, looking at the trees, listening to good tunes, taking pride in your work, having some up and down days -- truly perfect days
