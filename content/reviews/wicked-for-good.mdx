import Spoiler from '@components/ui/spoiler.astro';

- act ii was always the worse act, so i expected this to be worse than the first movie going in
- they expanded the story in the wrong places and kept the original in the wrong places
- i kept checking my watch throughout
- at some point i just wanted to skip ahead to the singing scenes
- set and costume design were spectacular
- michelle yeoh's singing (in)ability really stood out in this one
- i really liked the cinematography during, "the girl in the bubble"

<Spoiler>
  - are we supposed to assume boq wanted elphaba to let him die? i mean, sure i doubt being a tin man is a great life
  - fiyero when he first sees elphaba's hideout: "girl, you live like this?"
  - how did fiyero know elphaba would be hiding under the floor?
