- this is a vampire movie?
- cultural commentary with marty (jewish) vs. those in power (christian) and marty (us) vs. endo (japan)
- when does marty ever practice?
- pacing is perfect. right when you'd finish a story beat, they'd bring the pace down a bit, then ramp you straight back up.
- funnier than i expected
- acting was superb. shoutout mr. wonderful? everyone says he just played himself, but i disagree.
