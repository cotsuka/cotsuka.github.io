- easily the best of the prequels.
- dialogue is atrocious at multiple points. acting is pretty uneven, with some really bad scenes accentuated by odd close-up shots or cuts.
- just hit me over the head with the politics.
- anakin basically murders his fellow jedi because they won't call him master?
- lucas had no idea how to get to the end of this movie.
- sadly no jar jar binks memes
