- clearly had a political pov they wanted to push, but they don't do a good job of proving it with the story they showed on the screen
- sebastian stan slipped in and out of modern trump mannerisms throughout the film. i expected to see a change over time, but it seemed like he was more in-character for certain filming sessions versus others
- i'd honestly prefer a roy cohn biopic, going through each era of his career rebuilds
