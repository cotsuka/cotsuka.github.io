import Spoiler from '@components/ui/spoiler.astro';

- really a movie about chosen family: partners, children, pets
- in the culture war zeitgeist, but i don't think this movie really brought any new aspects to the superman character that it hasn't always been about in the first place
- nicholas hoult's lex luthor hits all the right notes
- seems like james gunn cribbed a bit from guardians of the galaxy:
  - mr. fantastic fight scene
  - justice gang
  - quippy, witty, jerk characters: guy gardner
- john wick: superman version
- gunn overstuffed this movie with different little bits and i wish he had edited them down a bit more

this movie has so many memeable instances:
