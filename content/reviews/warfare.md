- 90 minutes of pure combat, no cuts, no exposition, no preaching. i thought we were getting a rah america movie but this was something else.
- sound design is incredible. the first show of force scene's sound takes your breath away, the gunshots and explosions are disorienting.
- really puts you in the mindset of what these guys must have gone through. you never want to be in that situation.
