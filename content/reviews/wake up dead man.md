- the contrast between wicks' and duplenticy's views on their place within the faith made for a slightly interesting morality take. not deep enough to really go anywhere, but this movie is supposed to be a light, fun mystery thriller.
- immediately thought duplenticy was an unreliable narrator when i heard his name
- i dislike that the mystery feels unsolvable unless you follow along the story rails the movie provides. you can't really solve anything with the clues they give you until pretty far into the movie. maybe upon rewatch i'll change my mind on this?
- certainly better than glass onion
- most of the side characters feel underwritten and don't matter
- still a fun time
