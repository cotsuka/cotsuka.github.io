I am **Head of Data and Analytics** at Build Asset Management, where I've helped launch a [private credit fund](https://buildbitcoin.com) investing into over-collateralized bitcoin-backed loans, a [fixed income ETF](https://bfix.fund) and related vehicles, and built the internal tech stack that glues everything together.

Articles will tend towards serious. Other activities are likely more frivolous.
